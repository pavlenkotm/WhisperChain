- **Beginners**: TypeScript or Python
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity
- **Performance**: Rust or Go
- **Mobile**: Swift (iOS) or Java (Android)

### Do I need to know all 15 languages?
No! Each example is independent. Pick the languages relevant to your project.

### Where's language X?
We're always open to adding more languages! See [Contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Technical Questions

### How do I run the examples locally?
See [Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md) for detailed instructions per language.

### Are there tests?
Yes! Most examples include comprehensive test suites.

### Can I deploy to mainnet?
Yes, but:
1. Audit the code thoroughly
2. Test extensively on testnets
3. Consider professional security audit
4. Start with small amounts
